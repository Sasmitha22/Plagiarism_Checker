Von-Neumann Model:
Von-Neumann proposed his computer architecture design in 1945 which was later known as Von-Neumann Architecture. It consisted of a Control Unit, Arithmetic, and Logical Memory Unit (ALU), Registers and Inputs/Outputs.

Von Neumann architecture is computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory. This design is still used in most computers produced today.

A Von Neumann-based computer:
Uses a single processor.
Uses one memory data.
Executes programs following the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):
The Arithmetic  the required micro-operations for executing the instructions. In simple words.  (add, subtract, etc.) and logic (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) operations to be carried out.

Control Unit:
The Control Unit. the operations of components like ALU, memory and input/output devices.

The Control Unit consists of a program counter that contains the address. fetched and an instruction register into which instructions are fetched from memory for execution.

Registers:
Registers refer.areas in the CPU. The data. are fetched from the register.
