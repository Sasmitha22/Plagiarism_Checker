# Plagiarism_Checker
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive context-based plagiarism tool that can determine the similarity index between two documents in the same context, including textual content, code, and algorithms.

The input module allows users to compare two documents by providing URLs, pasting text directly, or uploading text files. Preprocessing includes tokenization, removing spaces, stop-words, and converting to lowercase. Comparison is done using B+ Tree and list data structures for efficient searching and indexing. The matching algorithm considers order and context for similarity detection. The user-friendly interface includes authentication, and MongoDB stores user login data and comparison results. Extensive testing and optimization ensure accuracy and performance. This tool aids in detecting plagiarism and promoting integrity in various domains.
