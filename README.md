# Plagiarism_Checker
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive context-based plagiarism tool that can determine the similarity index between two documents in the same context, including textual content, code, and algorithms. The input module allows users to compare two documents by providing URLs, pasting text directly, or uploading text files.
